Unlike code comments, code annotations are not stored in the source file but in an external file. The information you record is associated with a specific location in the code and can be viewed while you work on a source file. </p><p class="NormalText">You can use Code Annotations for recording various information, like comments about something that needs to be changed, tasks that need to be performed (see <a href="ch08s17.htm#sect_codeannotations_12976_39545">Using Code Annotations to Record Tasks</a>), or comments in preparation for a code review (see <a href="ch08s17.htm#sect_codeannotations_12976_49428">Using Code Annotations for Code Reviews</a>). Anything you can record in a code comment can be stored in a Code Annotation.</p><p class="NormalText">Because code annotations are not stored in the source code, you can use them to record private information you don't want to share with the rest of the team. Or you can use code annotations to record information that is shared with the team but should never be visible in the source code.</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_1010385"></a>

        <a class="indexterm" name="sect_codeannotations_DC1C5C63_437D"></a>Annotation Types</h4></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">Each annotation contains a set of data fields specific to that type of annotation. All annotations contain a set of default fields, including the author who created or last edited this annotation, and the date this annotation was last changed. Code annotations used for different purposes also include specific fields related to that purpose. For example, a task annotation will also have a due date and a field to record the person who has been assigned this task. A code review annotation will include a text field for the proposed resolution and a status field indicating whether this change was accepted or rejected.</p><p class="NormalText">SlickEdit® provides some predefined annotation types, but you can create your own by specifying the set of fields contained. For each field, you specify the name of the field, the type of the field, and the default value. When an annotation of that type is created, you are prompted for these values. See <a href="ch08s17.htm#sect_codeannotations_12976_32875">Managing Annotation Types</a> for more information.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_1010394"></a>

        <a class="indexterm" name="sect_codeannotations_1C7B10A8_81CF"></a>Purpose-Based Locations</h4></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">When you create a code annotation, you specify where it is to be stored. You select the location based on the purpose of the annotation. The location can be one of these values:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span class="bold"><strong>Personal</strong></span> - These annotations are for your own use and not intended to be shared with others. Personal annotations are stored in your configuration directory. They are not specific to any workspace.</p></li><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span class="bold"><strong>Workspace</strong></span> - Used to record information about files in the current workspace. The annotation file is stored in the same directory as your workspace file (<code class="filename">.vpw</code>) and uses the same base file name but with a different extension. These are intended to be shared with anyone else working in this workspace, so the annotation file should be checked into source control.</p></li><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span class="bold"><strong>Project</strong></span> - Used to record information about files in a specific project. The annotation file is stored in the same directory as your project file (<code class="filename">.vpj</code>) and uses the same base file name but with a different extension These are intended to be shared with anyone else working on this project.</p></li><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span class="bold"><strong>User-Defined</strong></span> - These annotations are stored in a file of your choice. These annotations cannot be readily shared since they store a full path to the referenced file. Unless two users have the same directory structure on their machines, the annotations will not be able to locate the referenced source files.</p></li></ul></div><p class="NormalText">Workspace and Project annotations are very similar. If you don't create too many annotations, you could save all of your annotations as Workspace annotations. However, if you have projects that are shared between workspaces, you should use Project annotations so that the information is available regardless of which workspace you are using. If you create a lot of annotations, you may wish to use Project instead of Workspace so that you can view the list of annotations for a single project, providing a way to view a more manageable subset of annotations.</p><p class="NormalText">See <a href="ch08s17.htm#sect_codeannotations_12976_15767">Managing Annotation Files</a> for more information.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_1010407"></a>

Annotations are shared by sharing the annotation file with other users. Like source files, annotation files are most easily shared using a version control system. </p><p class="NormalText">Only Workspace and Project annotations can be shared effectively. Because they refer to files in the workspace or project, the path to those files is stored relative to the workspace or project. Even if users have the same workspace in different directories, SlickEdit® will be able to locate the source files referenced by annotations. Personal annotations and User-Defined annotations are not sharable. They store a fully qualified path to the referenced file. Unless two people have the same directory hierarchy on their machines, SlickEdit will not be able to located the referenced source files.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_1010411"></a>
        <a class="indexterm" name="sect_codeannotations_6ACAB2DE_430A"></a>Relocatable Code Marker</h4></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">Code Annotations use a relocatable code marker to store the location within the source code. This allows SlickEdit® to find the new location if someone makes edits to the file externally, like editing the file with a different editor. The next time you open the file, SlickEdit checks the location of each code marker and verifies that it is still correct. If necessary, SlickEdit uses stored information to locate the correct line of code for this annotation. If the code has changed too much, SlickEdit may not be able to find the new location, and you will be prompted to find the new location yourself. This will only happen when the code near the code marker has been heavily edited.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_1010413"></a>Annotations Tool Window and File Manager</h4></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">SlickEdit provides a <span><strong class="guilabel">Code Annotations</strong></span> tool window that lists all of 
        the currently visible annotations. This tool window allows you to filter the set of visible 
        annotations. The primary filter is by type. If annotations of more than one type are displayed, 
        only the default fields common to all annotations are displayed in the annotation list. You can 
        use the tool window to create, edit, and delete code

SlickEdit automatically opens the annotations from your personal annotations file along with those from the workspace and project annotation files.

        <a class="indexterm" name="sect_codeannotations_AA4875D3_AC88"></a>Handling Annotation Type Conflicts</h4></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">Every annotation file contains the annotation type definitions for the annotations it contains. If a user modifies the type definition for an annotation, it will conflict with the type definition for annotations in other files. All annotation types by the same name must have the same definition. SlickEdit® detects any discrepancies between types and tries to rectify them. </p><p class="NormalText">When two conflicting types are found, SlickEdit prompts you for which definition to use. Once you have selected the master type, SlickEdit attempts to correct annotations that matched the other type. The resolution depends on the category of the change:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span><strong class="guilabel">Field added</strong></span> - The new master type contains a field not present in the other version of this annotation type. SlickEdit will add the new field to all annotations of that type the next time they are saved.</p></li><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span><strong class="guilabel">Field deleted</strong></span> - The new master type is missing a field that is present in the other version of this annotation type. SlickEdit will delete that field from all annotations of that type the next time they are saved. This will result in the data in that field being lost.</p></li><li><p class="NormalText">
            <span><strong class="guilabel">Field modified</strong></span> - The new master type contains a field by the same name as a field in the other annotation type but the definition of the two fields differ. SlickEdit will attempt to coerce the data from the one type to the other. Since all data is stored as text, this will work in many cases. In some cases this will result in data loss. For example, if data is coerced from a text type to a discrete type (like Dropdown, List, or Checkbox), data will be lost if the text value doesn't match one of the predefined values for this control.</p></li></ol></div><p class="NormalText">This system for resolving conflicts in Annotation Types does not allow you to merge two sets of changes to the same type. For example, if two users both add a field to the same type, one of them will be lost. Because of this, changes to annotation types should be made in a deliberate, planned manner and rolled out to the team in a way that avoids this issue. When a shared annotation type needs to be changed, have one person make that change and distribute a document with that type. The rest of the team can update their annotation files by opening that document while other documents are open. Remember, there is no centralized repository for annotation types, so conflict resolution is only performed on the set of open documents. To update multiple workspaces, you will have to open each workspace and then open the document containing the changed type.</p><p class="NormalText">To avoid conflicts in your personal annotation types, you may want to create your own types. Conflict resolution is performed using the name of the annotation type to uniquely identify a type. If the types you use in your personal annotations have their own, unique names then you can avoid conflicts with annotation types in other documents.</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="sect_codeannotations_12976_15767"></a>

In a typical code review process, code is reviewed by a number of team members, who record issues and forward their comments to a review coordinator. During the review, the comments are discussed and a resolution is recorded.</p><p class="NormalText">SlickEdit® includes an Annotation Type for code reviews, called <span><strong class="guilabel">Review Comment</strong></span>. Along with the standard fields, it also includes <span><strong class="guilabel">Issue</strong></span>, <span><strong class="guilabel">Resolution</strong></span>, and <span><strong class="guilabel">Status</strong></span>. If your review process requires a different set of fields, refer to <a href="ch08s17.htm#sect_codeannotations_12976_32875">Managing Annotation Types</a> for information on how to create your own.</p><p class="NormalText">There are many ways to implement a code review using SlickEdit and Code Annotations. We will describe one approach that should be the easiest. You may find other methods that work best with your processes.</p><p class="NormalText">Prior to the review, the review coordinator creates a Workspace in SlickEdit for the files to be reviewed. Copy those files to the Workspace directory and then add the files to the Workspace. If you have modified the stock definition of the Review Comment, you can make sure that everyone is using the same definition by creating a Workspace Annotation using that definition. You might put one on the first line of code with instructions for how to perform the review.</p><p class="NormalText">Send a copy of this workspace to each of the reviewers. This can be done by compressing the directory into a ZIP, TAR, or other archive file. Each reviewer then reviews the code and records their comments using the Review Comment annotation type as a Workspace annotation. When they are finished, they send the Workspace's <code class="filename">.sca</code> file back to the review coordinator.</p><p class="NormalText">The review coordinator will merge the <code class="filename">.sca</code> files 
      together to produce a single workspace annotation file. Since these are XML files, they are easy to 
      read and merge using many different tools. The consolidated annotation file is used for the review 
      walkthrough. You can also accomplish the sharing and merging with most source control tools. Many 
      provide automatic merging capabilities that will add the inserted lines into the master file. 
      You'll have to test your system to make sure that the merges it performs are safe. If not, you can 
      use SlickEdit's <a href="ch10s02.htm#sect_comparingmerging_13768_91853">DIFFzilla®</a> to compare and merge the 
      files.</p><p class="NormalText">During the review meeting, the review coordinator opens the single, merged document and then walks through the issues by double-clicking on each in the Code Annotation tool window. The review team discusses the recorded comment, and appropriate resolution remarks and status are recorded for each.</p><p class="NormalText"></p></div></div></body></html>
