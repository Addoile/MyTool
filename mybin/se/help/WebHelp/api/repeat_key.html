<h3><b>_command void repeat_key(_str command_string='')</b></h3>
<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription">Repeat a key event the number of times specified.
<p>
To use, after calling this command, type the number of times
you want to repeat a key, followed by the key itself. For
instance, the following key sequence (without the dashes):
<pre>
<b>repeat_key</b> - <b>68</b> - <b>*</b>
</pre>
inserts 68 instances of '*' to the current cursor location as
if the character was manually typed 68 times.
<p>
The key to be repeated is not limited to a single character,
but can be a command bound to a key stroke (such as Ctrl+V).
<p>
This command can also be called from the command line, in
which case it can take arguments in the following format:
<pre>
<b>repeat_key</b> -[repeat num] [command name] [command arguments]
</pre>
