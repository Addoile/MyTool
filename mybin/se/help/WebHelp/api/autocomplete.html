<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription">Update auto complete information on demand.  Note that normally,
invocation of auto complete mode happens automatically.
<p>
Automatic completion provides a comprehensive system to tie together
many of the most important features of SlickEdit into one consistent
framework.  Automatic completion works by dynamically suggesting completion
possibilities when they are discovered, and providing a one key solution
for selecting to perform the auto-completion, when is then executed as
if the specific command had actually been typed.
<p>
This frees the user from having to remember the key combination
associated with various completion mechanisms, all they really need
to remember is Space key.  And if they are an advanced user, they also
can use Ctrl+Shift+Space to incrementally pull in part of an auto
completion.
<p>
The features pulled into this system include:
<ul>
<li>Language specific syntax expansion
<li>Alias expansion
<li>Symbol completion using tagging
<li>Complete prev/next matches
<li>Command line history
<li>Command argument completion
<li>Text box dialog completion
</ul>
<p>
For the text box and combo box controls, this same system supplements
the existing completion mechanisms by providing a dynamic system for
displaying the matches, much like that used by the Windows file chooser.
<p>
For the SlickEdit command line, this system supplements command history
as well as command argument completion using the same display mechanism.
