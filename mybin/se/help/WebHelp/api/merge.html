<h3><b>_command int merge(_str arg1='')</b></h3>
<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription">Displays 3 Way Merge Setup dialog box.  A 3 Way Merge is typically used
after two people make a local copy of the same source file and make some
modifications to their local copy.   A 3 Way Merge very cleverly takes both
sets of changes and creates an new source file.   If there are any conflicts
(because they edited the same area of code), a dialog box is displayed which
lets you select whose change you want in the output file.  Our 3 Way Merge
lets you edit the output file without exiting 3 Way Merge mode.<p>
<P>Command line usage:
   merge [options] &lt;base&gt; &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt; &lt;out&gt;
<P>Command line options(case insensitive):
<UL>
<LI>   -bb                     - Base is a buffer name and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -bbi                    - Base is a buffer id and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -b1                     - rev1 is a buffer name and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -b1i                    - rev1 is a buffer id and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -b2                     - rev2 is a buffer name and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -b2i                    - rev2 is a buffer id and should be loaded +b w/o absolute
<LI>   -bout                   - output is a buffer name, and should not be deleted when
                             the merge dialog is closed(saved for the user).
<LI>   -bouti                  - output is a buffer id, and should not be deleted when
                             the merge dialog is closed(saved for the user).
<LI>   -smart                  - same as the "use smart merge" button on the dialog
                             (uses the diff to try to resolve some conflicts)
<LI>   -interleaved            - same as turning on "interleaved output" on dialog
<LI>   -q                      - quiet option:only shuts off "Merge complete x
                             conflicts" message
<LI>   -callersaves            - If this option is used, the file is not actually
                             saved after the user is prompted.  A 1 is returned
                             if the user chose to save the file.  Returns 2
                             if the user chose not to save the file.
<P style="margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocHeading"><B>Returns:</B> <B><code>int</code></b><blockquote style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><p style="margin-top:0pt;margin-left:-13pt;">If successful, returns: 1 if there were conflicts. if callersaves
   option is specified, returns 1 or 2. 0 if no conflicts.  Otherwise, a
   negative error code is returned.

   Note that "successful" implies nothing about the number of differences
   between the files, just that all files were loaded successfully,
   and the merge engine ran succesfully.
