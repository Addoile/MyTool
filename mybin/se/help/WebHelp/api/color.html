<h3><b>_command void color()</b></h3>
<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription">Displays the <b>Color Settings dialog box</b> which is used
to change the default colors.  Select the screen element.
Then set the foreground and background colors and press the
Apply or OK button.  The Apply button updates the colors you
have modified without closing the dialog box.
<pre>
<b>   Screen Element</b>   Select the screen element before changing the foreground and background colors.  Most of the screen element items are obvious except for the Cursor screen element.  The Cursor Screen Element is displayed in the active edit window when the cursor is placed on the SlickEdit command line.  It is not the color of the blinking cursor (wish we could change this color).
<b>   Apply</b>            Updates all modified screen elements.  The dialog box is not closed.
<b>   Reset</b>            Restores all colors to the values they were when the editor was invoked.
<b>   Cancel</b>           Restores all colors to the values they were when the colors dialog box was displayed.
