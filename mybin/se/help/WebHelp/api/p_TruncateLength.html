<h3><b>int p_TruncateLength</b></h3>
<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription"><p>If non-zero, this determines how text gets inserted/deleted and how
lines are truncated.  Tab characters are not expanded when this
property is set.  This property was added to support mainframe legacy
code which is very column oriented and is typically set to 72.  When
source code is written using ISPF, the last 8 columns (usually columns
73-80) are used for line numbers.  ISPF tries to make sure that when
text is inserted or deleted in columns 1-72 that the line numbers stay in
the same column.  This property has allows you to ensure that data to
the right of the truncation length does not change position.  In
addition, newly inserted lines are truncated at the length specified by
this property.  This property has no effect when saving a file.</p><p>
<p>The following built-in functions (and any command which accesses
these built-ins) are effected by this property:</p><p>
<dl>
<dt><b>_reflow_selection</b></dt><dd>
   Only text at or before the truncation length is reflowed.</dd><p>
<dt><b>insert_line</b>, <b>vsInsertLine</b></dt><dd>
   Lines longer than the truncation length are truncated.</dd><p>
<dt><b>replace_line</b>, <b>vsReplaceLine</b></dt><dd>
   Lines longer than the truncation length are truncated and
a error message is displayed.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_split_line</b>, <b>vsSplitLine</b></dt><dd>
   The text to the right of the truncation length stays on the
current line and is not inserted into the next line.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_join_line</b>, <b>vsJoinLine</b></dt><dd>
   The join is aborted if the join will create a line longer
than the truncation length.   An error status is returned if
the join is aborted.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_JoinLineToCursor</b>, <b>vsJoinLineToCursor</b></dt><dd>
   The join is aborted if the join will create a line longer
than the truncation length.   An error status is returned if
the join is aborted.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_insert_text</b>, <b>vsInsertText</b></dt><dd>
   Any resulting lines longer than the truncation length are
truncated.  In addition, the text to the right of the
truncation length on the current line is not effected.  If the
cursor is past the truncation length, the text is inserted
into the next line.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_delete_text</b>, <b>vsDeleteText</b></dt><dd>
   The text to the right of the truncation length on the
current line is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_delete_selection</b>,<b>vsDeleteSelection</b></dt><dd>
   The text to the right of the truncation length on the
current line is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>vsTruncQLineLength</b></dt><dd>
   Returns the length of the current line as if the text to the
right of the truncation length does not exist.  In addition,
trailing blanks (tab characters count) are not included in
the length.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_SearchInitSkipped</b>,<b>vsSearchInitSkipped</b></dt><dd>
   Call this function before performing search and replace
operation to reset NofSkipped and Skipped lines data
returned by the _SearchQSkipped and
_SearchQNofSkipped functions.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_SearchQSkipped</b>, <b>vsSearchQSkipped</b></dt><dd>
   Call this function after performing search and replace
operation to determine the line numbers where the
replace operation was skipped to avoid line truncation.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_SearchQNofSkipped</b>,<b>vsSearchQNofSkipped</b></dt><dd>
   Call this function after performing search and replace
operation to determine how many replace operations were
skipped to avoid line truncation.</dd><p>
<dt><b>keyin</b>, <b>vsKeyin</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length on the current
line is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>search</b>, <b>search_replace</b>, <b>vsSearch</b>,
<b>vsSearchReplace</b>, <b>vsRepeatSearch</b></dt><dd>
   Multi-line search or replace is not supported.  Search is
performed as if the data to the right of the truncation
length is not there.  Unfortunately, using regular
expressions to match the end of line ($) does not work as
if the data to the right of the truncation length is not there.
After a replace, the text to the right truncation length is
not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_overlay_block_selection</b>, <b>_adjust_block_selection</b>,
<b>_fill_selection</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_shift_selection_left</b>, <b>vsShiftSelectionLeft</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_shift_selection_right</b>, <b>vsShiftSelectionRight</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length is not effected.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_copy_to_cursor</b>, <b>vsCopyToCursor</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length is not effected.
Any resulting lines longer than then truncation length are
truncated.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_move_to_cursor</b></dt><dd>
   Text to the right of the truncation length is not effected.
Any resulting lines longer than then truncation length are
truncated.</dd>
</dl><p>
<p>The following built-in functions have been enhanced to support the
truncation length:</p><p>
<dl>
<dt><b>_expand_tabsc</b>, <b>vsExpandTabsC</b>,
<b>_expand_tabsc_raw</b></dt><dd>
   A width value of -2 specifies that the
<b>vsTruncQLineLength</b> be used instead of the real
line length.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_text_colc</b>, <b>vsTextColC</b></dt><dd>
   A new 'E' option specifies that the
<b>vsTruncQLineLength</b> be used instead of the real
line length.</dd>
</dl><p>
<p>The following built-in functions have been enhanced to support
maximum line length:</p><p>
<dl>
<dt><b>_save_file</b>, <b>vsSaveFile</b></dt><dd>
   A new +CL option (Check Line length option) was
added.  When specified, the new
<b>vsCheckLineLengths</b> function is called if the
output file has a required record length or if the source
file has a non-zero <b>p_MaxLineLength</b> property.</dd><p>
<dt><b>_CheckLineLengths</b>, <b>vsCheckLineLengths</b></dt><dd>
   Allows you to get a list of lines longer than a specified
line length.  Usually, <b>p_MaxLineLength</b> is
specified.</dd>
