<h3><b>int _save_file(_str cmdline="")</b></h3>
<P style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocDescription">Writes current buffer to file name specified.  If no name is specified,
the buffer name is used.
<P style="margin-bottom:0pt;" class="JavadocHeading"><B>Parameters:</B><blockquote style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><p style="text-indent:-13pt;margin-top:0pt;"><code><A NAME="pszCmdLine">pszCmdLine</A></code> - may contain an output filename in double quotes and
any of the following switches delimited with a space:

<p>(Note that since record files are saved in binary [always with the +B
switch], many options have no effect.)</p>

<dl>
<dt>+ or -E</dt><dd>Turn on/off expand tabs to spaces switch.
Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -G</dt><dd>Turn on/off setting of all old numbers.
Default is off.  SlickEdit uses old line
numbers to better handle going to an error
line after lines have been inserted or deleted.
We don't recommend setting the old line
numbers on every save because this requires
that you do not save the file until you have
performed edits for all compile or multi-file
search messages.  See
<b>_SetAllOldLineNumbers</b> method for
more information.</dd>

<dt>+ or -S</dt><dd>Strip trailing spaces on each line.  The buffer
is modified if the output file name matches
the buffer name.  Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -CL</dt><dd>Check maximum line length.  Default is off.
If the destination file requires a record length (an OS/390
data set member), lines are checked against this record
length. Otherwise, line lengths are checked against
the <b>p_MaxLineLength</b> property.  If there are any lines
that are too long, an error code is returned and a message
box is displayed with a list of the offending line numbers.
At the moment only the physical line length is checked as if
tab characters count as 1 character.  We may change this in
the future.</dd>

<dt>+FU</dt><dd>Save file in UNIX ASCII format (Lines
ending with just 10 character).  The buffer is
modified if the output file name matches the
buffer name.</dd>

<dt>+FD</dt><dd>Save file in DOS  ASCII format (Lines
ending with 13,10).  The buffer is modified if
the output file name matches the buffer name.</dd>

<dt>+FM</dt><dd>Save file in Macintosh ASCII format (Lines
ending with just 13 character).  The buffer is
modified if the output file name matches the
buffer name.</dd>

<dt>+<i>ddd</i></dt><dd>Save file without line end characters and pad
or truncate lines so that each line is
<i>ddd</i> characters in length.  Use this
option to generate of fixed length record file.</dd>

<dt>+FR</dt><dd>Save file without line end characters.</dd>

<dt>+F<i>ddd</i></dt><dd>Save file using ASCII character <i>ddd</i>
as the line end character.  The buffer is
modified if the output file name matches the
buffer name.  This option is not supported for
UTF-8 buffers.</dd>

<dt>+FTEXT</dt><dd>Saves file as SBCS/DBCS and converts
buffer data to SBCS/DBCS if necessary.  This
option is ignored if <b>p_binary</b>==true
or +B option specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF8</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-8 without a signature and
converts the buffer data to UTF-8 if
necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF8S</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-8 with a signature and
converts the buffer data to UTF-8 if
necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF16LE</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-16 little endian without a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF16LES</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-16 little endian with a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF16BE</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-16 big endian without a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF16BES</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-16 big endian with a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF32LE</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-32 little endian without a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF32LES</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-32 little endian with a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF32BE</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-32 big endian without a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FUTF32BES</dt><dd>Saves file as UTF-32 big endian with a
signature and converts the buffer data to
UTF-8 if necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.</dd>

<dt>+FCP<i>ddd</i></dt><dd>Saves file as SBCS/DBCS for the code page
file specified by <i>ddd</i> and converts the
buffer data to UTF-8 if necessary.  This
option is ignored if <b>p_binary</b>==true
or +B option specified.  Under windows, this
can be any valid code page or one of the
VSCP_* constants defined in "slick.sh."</dd>

<dt>+FACP</dt><dd>Saves file as SBCS/DBCS for the active code
page and converts the buffer data to UTF-8 if
necessary.  This option is ignored if
<b>p_binary</b>==true or +B option
specified.  Under windows, this can be any
valid code page or one of the VSCP_
constants defined in "slick.sh."</dd>

<dt>+ or -B</dt><dd>Binary switch.  Save file exactly byte per byte
as it appears in the buffer.  This option
overrides all save options which effect bytes
in the input or output.  This option is always
on for record buffers.  Defaults to value of
<b>p_binary</b> property for other buffers.</dd>

<dt>+ or -O</dt><dd>Overwrite destination switch (no backup).
Default is off.  Useful for writing a file to a
device such as the printer.</dd>

<dt>+ or -P</dt><dd>Add saved file to current project.
Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -T</dt><dd>Compress saved file with tab increments of 8.
Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -ZR</dt><dd>Remove end of file marker (Ctrl+Z).  This
option is ignored if the current buffer is not a
DOS ASCII file.  The buffer is modified if
the <b>p_showeof</b> is true and the output
file name matches the buffer name.  Default is
off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -Z</dt><dd>Add end of file marker (Ctrl+Z).  Note that if
a buffer has a visible EOF character, the
output file will still have an EOF character.
Use +ZR to ensure that the output file does
not have and EOF character.  Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -L</dt><dd>Reset line modify flags.  Default is off.</dd>

<dt>+ or -N</dt><dd>Don't save lines with the NOSAVE_LF bit
set.  When the editor keeps track of whether a
buffer has lines with the NOSAVE_LF bit set,
we will not need this option.</dd>

<dt>+ or -A</dt><dd>Convert destination filename to absolute.
Default is on.  This option is currently used to
write files to device names such as PRN.  For
example, "_save_file +o -a +e prn" sends the
current buffer to the printer.</dd>

<dt>+DB, -DB, +D,-D,+DK,-DK</dt><dd>
   These options specify the backup style.  The
default backup style is +D.  The backup styles
are:</dd>

<dl>
<dt>+DB, -DB</dt><dd>Write backup files into the same directory as
the destination file but change extension to
".bak".</dd>

<dt>+D</dt><dd>When on, backup files are placed in a single
directory.  The default backup directory is
"\vslick\backup\" (UNIX:
"$HOME/.vslick/backup") . You may define
an alternate backup directory by defining an
environment variable called
VSLICKBACKUP.  The VSLICKBACKUP
environment variable may contain a drive
specifier. The backup file gets the same name
part as the destination file.  For example,
given the destination file "c:\project\test.c"
(UNIX: "/project/test.c") , the backup  file
will be "c:\vslick\backup\test.c" (UNIX:
"$HOME/.vslick/backup/test.c").<br><br>

<b>Non-UNIX platforms</b>: For a network,
you may need to create the backup directory
with appropriate access rights manually
before saving a file.</dd>

<dt>-D</dt><dd>When on, backup file directories are derived
from concatenating a backup directory with
the path and name of the destination file.  The
default backup directory is "\vslick\backup\"
(UNIX: "$HOME/.vslick").  You may define
an alternate backup directory by defining an
environment variable called
VSLICKBACKUP.  The VSLICKBACKUP
environment variable may contain a drive
specifier.  For example, given the destination
file "c:\project\test.c", the backup file will be
"c:\vslick\backup\project\test.c" (UNIX:
"$HOME/.vslick/backup/project/test.c").<br><br>

<b>Non-UNIX platforms</b>: For a network, you
may need to create the backup directory with
appropriate access rights manually before
saving a file.</dd>

<dt>+DK,-DK</dt><dd>When on, backup files are placed in a
directory off the same directory as the
destination file.  For example, given the
destination file "c:\project\test.c" (UNIX:
"$HOME/.vslick"), the backup file will be
"c:\project\backup\test.c" (UNIX:
"/project/backup/test.c").  This option works
well on networks.</dd>
