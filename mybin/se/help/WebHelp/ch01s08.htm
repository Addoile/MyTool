      <a class="indexterm" name="sect_productimprovementprogram_00332_36798"></a>Product Improvement Program</h2></div></div></div><p class="NormalText">SlickEdit strives to meet the demands of its customers.  Without knowing what 
   features or languages our customers are using, it is a challenge to determine which areas of the 
   product need our attention most.  To close this information gap, we developed the Product Improvement 
   Program.  The program runs in the background, logging events as they happen 
    in your daily usage.  </p><p class="NormalText">We gather a variety of data, including information about command 
    invocation, toolbars and tool windows, settings, project and workspace usage, error 
    messages, and file types.  We do not make any record of file, project, or workspace 
    names, directory structures, or source code.  </p><p class="NormalText">Periodically, the compiled data is sent to SlickEdit.  The first 
    time the program tries to send data, you are prompted.  </p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="Resources/pip_prompt.png"></div><p class="NormalText">The dialog contains a link to preview the data that was compiled before 
    deciding to send it to SlickEdit.  You can also get more information by clicking the 
    <span><strong class="guilabel">Product Improvement Program Info</strong></span> link, which takes you to an 
    informational page on SlickEdit's website.</p><p class="NormalText">Select the <span><strong class="guilabel">Yes</strong></span> radio button to send the data and continue 
    your participation. If you do not wish to have any data logged or sent to SlickEdit, select the 
    <span><strong class="guilabel">No</strong></span> option.  After making your selection, click <span><strong class="guilabel">OK</strong></span>.  You can 
    also click the <span><strong class="guilabel">Ask me later</strong></span> button to postpone the data transmission.  No data 
    will be sent at that time, and you will be prompted again later.  You can also change your 
    participation status at any time by going to <span><strong class="guimenu">Tools </strong></span> &#8594; <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Options </strong></span> &#8594; <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Application Options </strong></span> &#8594; <span><strong class="guimenuitem">Product Improvement Program</strong></span>.  For more 
    information about these options, see <a href="ch12s11.htm#sect_options_menuanddialogs_40102_17486">Product Improvement Program Options</a>.</p><p class="NormalText">After this first prompt, if you agree to participate in the program, 
    all data transmissions are completely silent.  Transmission only occurs at start-up of the 
    application or when the editor has been idle for a period of time, thus causing the least 
    possible disruption to your work.</p><p class="NormalText">All data is completely anonymous.  We do construct a source ID to 
    enable us to determine how many data sources we have.  This ID is a concatenation of 
    machine name, user name, and serial number that is then hashed.  The hash result is used 
    as the ID.  Therefore, even with a unique ID for each user, we are unable to associate an 
    ID with any particular person or source.</p></div></body></html>
